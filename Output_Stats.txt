##### Community Composition Percentages ######

For the FOSSIL ONLY dataset (combines DSDP 596 and ODP 886):
There are 1381 denticles in this dataset, of which 1263 are identifiable to a Morphotype or category:
798 from DSDP Site 596
465 from ODP Site 886.

The full fossil dataset consists of:
461 Geometric (33.38 %)
781 Linear (56.55 %)
21 Smooth (1.52 %)
0 Spines (0 %)
118 Unclassifiable Denticles (8.54 %)

The pre-extinction fossil dataset consists of:
460 Geometric (34.18 %)
752 Linear (55.87 %)
18 Smooth (1.34 %)
0 Spines (0 %)
116 Unclassifiable Denticles (8.62 %)
For a total of 1346 denticles pre-extinction.

The post-extinction fossil dataset consists of:
1 Geometric (2.86 %)
29 Linear (82.86 %)
3 Smooth (8.57 %)
0 Spines (0 %)
2 Unclassifiable Denticles (5.71 %)
For a total of 35 denticles post-extinction.

Using a Chi-square test of independence, we calculate that the pre-extinction denticle assemblage is significantly different from the post-extinction denticle assemblage:
 	Pearson's Chi-squared test  data:  chisq.tbl X-squared = 26.493, df = 3, p-value = 7.519e-06 


##### Fossils ONLY: Morphotype Extinction Calculations #####

There are  89  fossil morphotypes,  83  observed at DSDP Site 596 and  54  observed at ODP Site 886.
33 geometric morphotypes, including "GenGeom"
53 linear morphotypes, including "GenLin"
2 smooth morphotypes
0 spine morphotypes
1 unclassifiable catch-all type

Of these,  89  morphotypes are present prior to 19 Ma, while only  10  are present in the fossil record after the extinction event, a  88.764 % decline in morphotype diversity in open ocean sediments
Of the 33 geometric morphotypes, 1 are found after the extinction (96.97% observed extinction)
Of the 53 linear morphotypes, 7 are found after the extinction (86.792% observed extinction)

If we exclude the unclassiiable morphotype, these numbers become:
Of the 88 morphotypes present prior to 19 Ma,  only 9 are present in the fossil record after the extinction event, a 89.773% decline in morphotype diversity in open ocean sediments
Of the 33 geometric morphotypes, 1 are found after the extinction (96.97% observed extinction)
Of the 53 linear morphotypes, 7 are found after the extinction (86.792% observed extinction)

The 9 morphotypes which are present in the <19 Ma fossil record (e.g. the survivors) are:
Angular Straight Edge
Asymmetrical Kite with Oval Center
Chubby Trident
Five Ridged Linear Fan
Five Thin Ridged Fan
GenLin
Ridged Circle
Smooth
Trident

There are  7  unique surviving morphotypes at DSDP Site 596, and  6  at ODP Site 886

If we *also* exclude the generic "genlin" and "gengeo" morphotypes, these numbers become:
Of the,  86  morphotypes present prior to 19 Ma,  only  8  are present in the fossil record after the extinction event, a  90.698 % decline in morphotype diversity in open ocean sediments
Of the 32 geometric morphotypes, 1 are found after the extinction (96.875% observed extinction)
Of the 52 linear morphotypes, 6 are found after the extinction (88.462% observed extinction)

There are 26 fossil denticle morphotypes that have a modern analog:
Branching Fan
Central Ridged Extended Trident
Central Ridged Triangle

Of the,  88  morphotypes present prior to 19 Ma,  only  26  are present in the fossil record and/or our modern database after the extinction event, a  70.455 % extinction in morphotype diversity.
Of the 33 geometric morphotypes, 6 are occur after the extinction, either in the fossils or by a modern analog (81.818% observed extinction)
Of the 53 linear morphotypes, 18 are found after the extinction, either in the fossils or by a modern analog (66.038% observed extinction)


##### Number of investigated Neogene and Paleogene Samples wih denticles #####

Of the 38 samples at DSDP Site 596 post-extinction (<19 Ma), only 17 have denticles present.
Compared to 65 samples at DSDP Site 596 pre-extinction (19-41 Ma), 65 have denticles present.
At DSDP Site 596 post-extinction, there is an average of 0.82 denticles per sample and 22.11 teeth per sample.
Before the extinction, there is an average of 13 denticles per sample and 60.63 teeth per sample.

Of the 54 samples at ODP Site 886 post-extinction (<19 Ma), only 15 have denticles present.
Compared to 81 samples at ODP Site 886 pre-extinction (22-35 Ma), 81 have denticles present.
At ODP Site 886 post-extinction, there is an average of 0.5 denticles per sample and 34.19 teeth per sample.
Before the extinction, there is an average of 27.37 denticles per sample and 107.91 teeth per sample.

In total, there were 92 samples investigated from after the extinction event (<19 Ma). Of these only 32 have any denticles at all (34.78%)
